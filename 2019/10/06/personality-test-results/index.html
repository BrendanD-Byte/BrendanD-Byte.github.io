<h1>What’s Your Learning Style? The Results</h1>



<p><strong>Your scores:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Auditory: 5%</li><li>Visual: 20%</li><li>Tactile: 75%</li></ul><p>You are a <strong>Tactile</strong> learner! Check out the information below, or <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-styles.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">view all of the learning styles</a>.</p>



<h2>Tactile</h2>



<p>If you are a tactile learner, you learn by touching and doing. You understand and remember things through physical movement. You are a “hands-on” learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what you learn, and you tend to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved. You need to be active and take frequent breaks, you often speak with your hands and with gestures, and you may have difficulty sitting still.</p>



<p>As a tactile learner, you like to take things apart and put things together, and you tend to find reasons to tinker or move around when you become bored. You may be very well coordinated and have good athletic ability. You can easily remember things that were done but may have difficulty remembering what you saw or heard in the process. You often communicate by touching, and you appreciate physically expressed forms of encouragement, such as a pat on the back.</p>



<p>Here are some things that tactile learners like you can do to learn better:</p>



<ul><li>Participate in activities that involve touching, building, moving, or drawing.</li><li>Do lots of hands-on activities like completing art projects, taking walks, or acting out stories.</li><li>It’s <abbr title="O K">OK</abbr> to chew gum, walk around, or rock in a chair while reading or studying.</li><li>Use flashcards and arrange them in groups to show relationships between ideas.</li><li>Trace words with your finger to learn spelling (finger spelling).</li><li>Take frequent breaks during reading or studying periods (frequent, but not long).</li><li>It’s <abbr title="O K">OK</abbr> to tap a pencil, shake your foot, or hold on to something while learning.</li><li>Use a computer to reinforce learning through the sense of touch.</li></ul><p>Remember that you learn best by <strong>doing</strong>, not just by reading, seeing, or hearing.</p>



<p>These results help me understand why i struggle to study for exams simply by reading or listening to content and will help me to adapt my learning experience is future course and help me adapt my work life to get the most out of the learning experiences avaliable to me.</p>



<h2>Personality Trait Scores</h2>



<p>This Big Five assessment measures your scores on five major dimensions of personality: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (sometimes abbreviated OCEAN). </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/OCEAN.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/OCEAN.png 695w,../../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/OCEAN-300x191.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 695px) 100vw, 695px"></figure><h3>Openness</h3>



<p>Openness describes a person’s tendency to think in abstract, complex ways. High scorers tend to be creative, adventurous, and intellectual. They enjoy playing with ideas and discovering novel experiences. Low scorers tend to be practical, conventional, and focused on the concrete. They tend to avoid the unknown and follow traditional ways.</p>



<p>Openness is strongly related to a person’s interest in art and culture. People who are high in openness tend to enjoy the arts and seek out unusual, complex forms of self-expression. People who are low in openness are often suspicious of the arts and prefer to focus on more practical pursuits.</p>



<h3>Conscientiousness</h3>



<p>Conscientiousness describes a person’s ability to exercise self-discipline and control in order to pursue their goals. High scorers are organized and determined, and are able to forego immediate gratification for the sake of long-term achievement. Low scorers are impulsive and easily sidetracked.</p>



<p>The concept of Conscientiousness focuses on a dilemma we all face: shall I do what feels good now, or instead do what is less fun but will pay off in the future? Some people are more likely to choose fun in the moment, and thus are low in Conscientiousness. Others are more likely to work doggedly toward their goals, and thus are high in this trait.</p>



<h3>Extraversion</h3>



<p>Extraversion describes a person’s inclination to seek stimulation from the outside world, especially in the form of attention from other people. Extraverts engage actively with others to earn friendship, admiration, power, status, excitement, and romance. Introverts, on the other hand, conserve their energy, and do not work as hard to earn these social rewards.</p>



<p>Extraversion seems to be related to the emotional payoff that a person gets from achieving a goal. While everyone experiences victories in life, it seems that extroverts are especially thrilled by these victories, especially when they earn the attention of others. Getting a promotion, finding a new romance, or winning an award are all likely to bring an extrovert great joy. In contrast, introverts do not experience as much of a “high” from social achievements. They tend to be more content with simple, quiet lives, and rarely seek attention from others.</p>



<h3>Agreeableness</h3>



<p>Agreeableness describes a person’s tendency to put others’ needs ahead of their own, and to cooperate rather than compete with others. People who are high in Agreeableness experience a great deal of empathy and tend to get pleasure out of serving and taking care of others. They are usually trusting and forgiving.</p>



<p>People who are low in Agreeableness tend to experience less empathy and put their own concerns ahead of others. Low scorers are often described as hostile, competitive, and antagonistic. They tend to have more conflictual relationships and often fall out with people.</p>



<h3>Neuroticism</h3>



<p>Neuroticism describes a person’s tendency to experience negative emotions, including fear, sadness, anxiety, guilt, and shame. While everyone experiences these emotions from time to time, some people are more prone to them than others.</p>



<p>This trait can be thought of as an alarm system. People experience negative emotions as a sign that something is wrong in the world. You may be in danger, so you feel fear. Or you may have done something morally wrong, so you feel guilty. However, not everyone has the same reaction to a given situation. High Neuroticism scorers are more likely to react to a situation with fear, anger, sadness, and the like. Low Neuroticism scorers are more likely to brush off their misfortune and move on.</p>
